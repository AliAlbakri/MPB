When discussing the differences between startups and corporates, it's often said that you can't truly understand them until you've experienced both environments firsthand. While there are countless aspects to consider, the core distinction can be encapsulated in this idea:Â **freedom fosters responsibility, whereas its absence breeds carelessness**.

Startups like Netflix exemplify this principle by granting their employees greater freedom[1], which in turn enhances their sense of responsibility. This approach contrasts sharply with the typical corporate environment.

In many corporates, the emphasis is on rigid structures such as clocking in and out, adhering to dress codes, maintaining hierarchical order, and navigating office politics. These practices often overshadow what should be the primary focus: **employee outcomes**.

In contrast, successful startups prioritize outcomes over traditional corporate norms. They concentrate on what employees achieve rather than how they fit into a predefined mold. This focus on results rather than processes allows startups to innovate and adapt more rapidly than their corporate counterparts.


##### Notes

[1] A prime example of this principle is Netflix's "no vacation policy." This policy allows employees to take as many vacation days as they need without tracking their time off. By granting such freedom, Netflix enhances employees' sense of responsibility, trusting them to manage their own time effectively while focusing on outcomes. Reed Hastings has cited this policy on multiple occasions as enhancing overall employee responsibility.
