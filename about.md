 I'm Ali, a product contributor with a passion for technology, innovation, and the dynamic world of startups. With a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from <a href="https://kfupm.edu.sa/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KFUPM</a>. 
 
  My fintech journey has been a thrilling ride through the heart of payment innovation. At <a href="https://tamara.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tamara</a>, Saudi Arabia's first fintech unicorn, I orchestrated seamless payment experiences across the GCC. My path then led me to <a href="https://Salla.sa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Salla</a>, where I revolutionized the checkout experience, aligning it with cutting-edge market trends. 
  
  Today, I'm crafting products from the ground up at <a href="https://alrajhibank.com.sa/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AlRajhi Bank</a>. Throughout this adventure, I've honed my skills in creating impactful payment solutions and driving product strategies that shape the future of fintech.
I am deeply interested in product management, startups, and angel investing. My work is driven by Agile methodologies and a commitment to delivering high-quality products that meet both market demands and customer needs.
